New section Macros
Unfortunately macros can't be universal for all puzzles and must be written to every puzzle individually.
At this moment macros from this section can't be used in a Figure section. It will be changed in future.
Public = "1" - macro is visible in a macros list
Name - can't include spaces to allow execution of Macro strings like "F2 B2"
At this moment macro name is case sensitive.
Macro "Scramble" - special macro that replaces standard scrambling
Description and Sequence - Any text
At this moment all turns are defined with exact axis, so macros can't be used for puzzle's solution, but in future I'll rework it.
